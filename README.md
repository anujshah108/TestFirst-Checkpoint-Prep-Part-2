##TestFirst JavaScript Overview   


## Assignment

To get a great overview of what TestFirst learning and development is watch the following video about [TestFirst](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MRDJPHMpaQ).

For an introduction to Test-Driven Development, read the first three sections of [The Newbie's Guide to Test-Driven Development](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/the-newbies-guide-to-test-driven-development--net-13835) ("What is Test-Driven Development?", "How does it work?", and "Great, but how is this better than regular testing?")   

Let's warm up by learning to read tests and write code to match a test's expectations. Read more about the philosophy of Test-First Learning at [TestFirst.org](http://testfirst.org/about#whytestfirstteaching).


## Setup

To start, we need to fork the repository via Assessdot and install `testem`, a Node test-runner that will run your test and code.


## Debugging Methods

The key skill here to practice is debugging JavaScript inside Chrome. You should become comfortable with these methods:

1.  Using the `console` via `console.log` and `debugger`
2.  Stepping through your JS in the Console and evaluating variables

This is a great blog post on the topic:
